## The Idea

Wow, this project took me a whole day and now i have a neck ache.

The main idea behind the project came from my lazyness and forgetfulness. I often forget to write a shopping list and often forget what kind of food i like, so doing it on the fly is a no go. The idea for this project is to create a shopping list instantly with almost no effort from myself.

So Simple project, I have a JSON file of meals and their required ingredients, random meals are picked for a week and can be changed or even re-written to make your desired meal plan.

Then, when the meal plan is created, it finds the ingredients for the meal and adds it to a shopping list. You can remove any items from the shopping list that you don't need or don't want. This allows me to create a meal plan for the week in a number of seconds.

## Why it took a day

So, the whole idea doesn't make any sense if it can only be done on a laptop. I don't take my laptop to the super market, and I often don't have my laptop when I need to make the list in a rush. So making it mobile accessable is a must have.

The only problem is that I don't know how to do that. Never done it before and its a whole new ball game for me. I do know some parts, like changing the CSS on certain screen sizes and I have an idea of what I want it to look like, but its not my forte. So adding this to the website was a struggle and generally annoying. Who new making good CSS was hard, I'm so good at making bad/mediocre CSS

Anyways. The main issue was navigation, the navbar and font was too small so I couldn't actually get to the meal planner let alone use it. Other than that it was a case of making everything bigger. Had I thought ahead, I could have used variables for all of the sizes, but instead I had to change this later on.

## Was it worth it

Erm ... I don't know. I still have to enter more meals into the JSON file so it works correctly, and there may be some feture requests later on, but for now I'm happy with the outcome. Guess I'll find out if it is useful when I use it :/

Cheers
