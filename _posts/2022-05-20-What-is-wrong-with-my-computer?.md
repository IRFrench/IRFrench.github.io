## My website

This is my first post, of my first blog, on my first website. Don't expect anything special.

Having a website and a blog is something that I have wanted, maybe even needed, for a while. I'm hoping that this blog will not only express my opinion and experience with technology, but also improve my writing skills. Therefore, if you have any comments or ideas on how to improve, please let me know.

You can leave comments through a pull request or raising an issue while I look into setting up a comment system.

### Experimenting with Jekyll

I chose Github pages for my website hosting as it is a free and easy way to create a blog. It seems like the best starting place and I highly recommend using Github pages for your website if you are looking to create one.

Jekyll is how Github pages is able to create some amazing websites. This is the story behind my website and how i made it.

### Starting out

Working with Jekyll was something completely new and different for me. I was told about Github pages and Jekyll by a work collegue and how powerfull of a tool it was. I decided this was good enough reason to build a small website for myself and try to create something to improve my skills.

First off, I needed to look into [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) which quickly led me into creating my first site. This was so simple and easy, it makes almost no sense to not create on for yourself.

Once a working page was made, the next step was design. Jekyll has many [themes](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-with-the-theme-chooser) available with Github pages, so I choose the one that best suited me. With this done it was easy to add new pages and design the site, as well as experiment with the blogs.

Although Github Pages will deploy your site when you push to the repository, I highly recommend using the [Jekyll deployment](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) in order to view your site before it goes live.

After setting up the basic Jekyll website it was simple to get started, and after setting it all up properly, it was the perfect option for a first blog

### Blogging with Github pages

The [Github pages docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) are almost specified to build a blog with jekyll. However, I haven't had any experience with jekyll or blogging so this will be interesting.

I wanted to layout this blog as a showcase for my website. Showing how it was made, and what my plans are for this site and improve my writing / computing skills.

### What is next

Along with weekly blogs, I will try to implement a comment system into the website. I would like to hear your opinion on how I could improve my writing, or maybe just let me know what you think of the posts.

Alongside this, I have plans to build a creative website for myself. However I am not sure whento start or how long this will take.
