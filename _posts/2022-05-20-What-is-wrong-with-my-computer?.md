## Experimenting with Jekyll

Jekyll is how Gitub pages is able to create some amazing websites. This is the story behind my website and how i made it

### Starting out

Working with Jekyll was something completely new and different for me. I was told about Github pages and Jekyll by a work collegue and how powerfull of a tool it was. I decided this was good enough reason to build a small website for myself and try to create something to improve my skills.

First off, I needed to look into [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) which quickly led me into creating my first site. This was so simple and easy, it makes almost no sense to not create on for yourself.

Once a working page was made, the next step was design. Jekyll has many [themes](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-with-the-theme-chooser) available with Github pages, so I choose the one that best suited me. With this done it was easy to add new pages and design the site, as well as experiment with the blogs.

### Blogging with Github pages

The [Github pages docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) are almost specified to build a blog with jekyll. However, it does not tell you how to write a blog, that part i am still getting the hang of.
