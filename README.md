# What is wrong with my computer?

This is my Github pages blog site where i will add new entries about new and interesting technologies / experiences that i have come across in my life.

This is not a professional blog and will probably (but not hopefully) be useless for everyone. However i am doing this to improve my writing ability as well as experiment with new technologies.

If you would like to add an article to this page (I don't know why you would), please create the article as you would a [jekyll post](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) (i.e `yyyy-mm-dd-title`) under the _posts directory, and then submit a push request.
