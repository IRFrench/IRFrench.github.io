# Isaac French

Currently working at [Exa Networks](https://exa.net.uk) as a junior engineer in the R&D department during my placement year at the [University of Bradford](https://www.bradford.ac.uk/external/). I will be continuing my studies of Computer Science for my bachelor's degree during my 4th year.

This is not a professional blog and will probably (but not hopefully) be useless to everyone. However I am doing this to improve my writing ability as well as experiment with new technologies. This blog will be based around my experiences with different technologies and will often contain my opinion, however my opinion should not deter anyone from the technology or systems in question.
